In order to release Meteo you need a Sonatype account connected to the Meteo project. Contact Jakob to get help on this.

You also need to configure a special settings.xml to use when releasing. Also ask Jakob about this.

Releasing Meteo:

* mvn release:prepare
* mvn release:perform
* Goto https://oss.sonatype.org/ and log in.
* Click on staging repositories and find your release.
* Click on the release and hit the close button, then the release button.

The release will be available in the Central Repo within a day.
